GIS deals with what and where\ncomponents of occurrences. For example, to regulate rapid transportation,\ngovernment decides to build fly-over (what component) in those areas of the city\nwhere traffic jams are common (where component).\nGeographic information systems (GIS) apply computer technology to the tasks\nof capturing, storing, manipulating, analyzing, modeling, and displaying information\nabout the surface of the Earth, and the phenomena distributed on it. They have\nemerged over the past three decades as a distinct form of computer use, with its own\nsoftware industry and array of products, directed at applications ranging from\nmanagement of the resources of utility companies, to support for global change\nscience. Worldwide sales of GIS software in the late 1990s were in the region of $600\nmillion annually, with much larger investments in associated digital geographic data.\nGIS means differently to different people and therefore has different definitions.\nFor example, Burrough (1998) defined GIS as “ a powerful set of tools for collecting,\nstoring, retrieving at will, transforming and displaying spatial data from the real\nworld for a particular set of purposes”\nObjectives of GIS\nSome of the major objectives of GIS are to\n Maximizing the efficiency of planning and decision making\n Integrating information from multiple sources\n Facilitating complex querying and analysis\n Eliminating redundant data and minimizing duplication\nLike any other information technology, GIS can be divided into the following four\nfundamental parts: computer system, GIS software, brainware, and infrastructure.\nComputer System The computer system includes the computer and the operating\nsystem to run GIS. Typically the choices are PCs that use the Windows operating\nsystem or workstations that use the UNIX operating system. Additional equipment may\ninclude monitors for display, digitizers and scanners for spatial data input, and\nprinters and plotters for hard copy data display.\n1",

Common user interfaces in GIS are menus, graphical icons, and\ncommands.\nBrainware Equally important as the computer hardware and software, the brainware\nrefers to the purpose and objectives, and provides the reason and justification, for\nusing GIS.\nInfrastructure The infrastructure refers to the necessary physical, organizational,\nadministrative, and cultural environments for GIS operations. The infrastructure\nincludes requisite skills, data standards, data clearinghouses, and general\norganizational patterns.\nSince the 1970’s, GIS has been important in natural resource management, such as\nland use planning, timber management, wildlife habitat analysis, riparian zone\nmonitoring, and natural hazard assessment. In more recent years, GIS has been used\nin emergency planning, market analysis, facilities management, transportation\nplanning, and military applications. Integration of GIS with other technologies such as\nGlobal Positioning System (GPS) and the Internet has introduced new applications.\nThe ability of GIS to handle and process geographically referenced data\ndistinguishes GIS from other information systems. Geographically referenced data\ndescribe both the location and characteristics of spatial features on the Earth’s surface.\nRoads and land use types are spatial features as are precipitation and elevation. In\ndescribing a road, for example, we need to refer to its location (i.e., where it is)\nand its characteristics (road classification, traffic volume, etc). GIS therefore involves\ntwo geographic data components: spatial data relating to the geometry of spatial\nfeatures, and attribute data giving the information about the spatial features.\nIt is often helpful to think of a GIS as a computer containing maps. One of the\nsimplest reasons for manipulating maps with computers is to make them easier to\nconstruct and draw, and GIS are often used for this purpose. By computerizing the\nmap-making process it is possible to edit easily, manipulate the map's contents\nwithout the labor-intensive task of redrafting, communicate maps electronically, and\ncreate output in any convenient form. The advent of GIS has made it possible for\nanyone to be a cartographer who is in possession of the necessary software, a\ncomputer to run it on, and a suitable printing device.\nFUNCTION OF GIS\nThe Functions of GIS describe the steps that have to be taken to implement a\nGIS. These steps have to be followed in order to obtain a systematic and efficient\nsystem. The steps involved are:\ni. Data Capture.\nii. Data Compilation.\niii. Data Storage (GIS Data Models).\niv.

        "content": "v. Analysis.\ni) Data Capture\nData used in GIS often come from many sources. Data sources are mainly\nobtained from Manual Digitization and Scanning of aerial photographs, paper maps,\nand existing digital data sets. Remote sensing satellite imagery and GPS are promising\ndata input sources for GIS.\nDigitization; A conversion process which converts paper maps into numerical\ndigits that can be stored in the computer. Digitizing simplifies map data into sets of\npoints, lines, or cells that can be stored in the GIS computer.In this stage Digitization is\ncarried out. There are two basic methods of Digitization: Manual Digitizing &\nScanning. Digitization is of two types : Head Up(Digitization tablet) and Head\nDown(Computer screen).\nii) Data Compilation\nFollowing the digitization of map features, the user completes the compilation\nphase by relating all spatial features to their respective attributes, and by cleaning up\nand correcting errors introduced as a result of the data conversion process.The end\nresults of compilation is a set of digital files, each accurately representing all of the\nspatial and attribute data of interest contained on the original map manuscripts. These\ndigital files contain geographic coordinates for spatial objects (points, line polygons\nand cells) that represent mapped features.\niii) Data Storage (GIS Data Models)\n Once the data have been digitally compiled, digital map files in the GIS are\nstored on magnetic or other digital media. Data storage is based on a Generic\nData Model that is used to convert map data into a digital form.\n The two most common types of data models are Raster and Vector. Both types\nare used to simplify the data shown on a map into a more basic form that can be\neasily and efficiently stored in the computer.\niv) Manipulation\n Once data are stored in a GIS, many manipulation options are available to\nusers. These functions are often available in the form of \"Toolkits.\" A toolkit is\na set of generic functions that a GIS user can employ to manipulate and\nanalyze geographic data. Toolkits provide processing functions such as data\nretrieval measuring area and perimeter, overlaying maps, performing map\nalgebra, and reclassifying map data.\n Data manipulation tools include Coordinate change, Projections, and Edge\nmatching, which allow a GIS to reconcile irregularities between map layers or\nadjacent map sheets called Tiles.\nv) Analysis\nThe heart of GIS is the analytical capabilities of the system. What distinguish the\nGIS system from other information system are its spatial analysis functions. Although\nthe data input is, in general, the most time consuming part, it is for data analysis that\nGIS is used. The analysis functions use the spatial and non-spatial attributes in the\ndatabase to answer questions about the real world. Geographic analysis facilitates the\nstudy of real-world processes by developing and applying models. Such models\n3",

Results of geographic analysis can be communicated with the help of maps,\nor both.\nGIS APPLICATIONS\nMapping Locations: GIS can be used to map locations. GIS allows the creation of\nmaps through automated mapping, data capture, and surveying analysis tools.\nMapping Quantities: People map quantities, like where the most and least are, to\nfind places that meet their criteria and take action, or to see the relationships between\nplaces. This gives an additional level of information beyond simply mapping the\nlocations of features.\nMapping Densities: While you can see concentrations by simply mapping the\nlocations of features, in areas with many features it may be difficult to see which areas\nhave a higher concentration than others. A density map lets you measure the number\nof features using a uniform areal unit, such as acres or square miles, so you can\nclearly see the distribution.\nFinding Distances: GIS can be used to find out what's occurring within a set distance\nof a feature. mapping and monitoring change: GIS can be used to map the change in\nan area to anticipate future conditions, decide on a course of action, or to evaluate the\nresults of an action or policy.\nSPATIAL DATA MODELS\nGIS uses two basic data models to represent spatial features: vector and raster. The\ndata model determines how the data are structured, stored, processed, and analyzed in\na GIS. The vector data model uses points and their x, y coordinates to construct spatial\nfeatures of points, lines, and areas. Vector-based features are treated as discrete objects\nover the space. The raster data model uses a grid to represent the spatial variation of a\nfeature. Each cell in the grid has a value that corresponds to the characteristic of the\nspatial feature at that location. Raster data are well suited to the representation of\ncontinuous spatial features like precipitation and elevation. Many GIS functions are\neither vector-based or raster-based.\n1.1. Vector Data Model\nThe vector data model consists of three types of geometric objects: point, line, and\narea. A point may represent a gravel pit, a line may represent a stream, and an area\nmay represent a vegetated area. A point has 0 dimension. A point feature occupies a\n4",

A line feature is made of\npoints: a beginning point, an end point, and a series of points marking the shape of\nthe line, which may be a smooth curve or a connection of straight-line segments. Line\nfeatures may intersect or join with other lines and may form a network.\nAn area is two-dimensional and has the properties of area and boundary. The\nboundary of an areal feature separates the interior area from the exterior area. Areal\nfeatures may be isolated or connected. They may overlap one another, and may form\nholes within other areas.\nVector data representation using point, line, area, and volume is not always\nstraightforward because it may depend on map scale and, occasionally, criteria\nestablished by government mapping agencies. A city on a 1:1,000,000-scale map is\nrepresented as a point, but the same city is shown as an area on a 1:24,000-scale map.\nA stream is shown as a single line near its headwaters but as an area along its lower\nreaches. In this case, the width of the stream may determine how it should be\nrepresented on a map. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) uses single lines to represent\nstreams less than 40 feet wide on 1:24,000-scale topographic maps and double lines for\nlarger streams. When hydrography becomes a layer in Digital Line Graph (DLG) data,\nstreams in single lines are digitized as lines, and streams in double lines are digitized\nas areas. Therefore, a stream may appear as a line or an area depending on its width\nand the criterion used by the government agency involved in creating the maps.\nVector data may be topological or non-topological. ARC/INFO coverages are\ntopological and shapefiles are non-topological. Topology expresses explicitly the\nspatial relationships between geometric objects. ARC/INFO coverages support three\nbasic topological concepts:\n• Connectivity: Arcs connect to each other at nodes\n• Area definition: An area is defined by a series of connected arcs\n• Contiguity: Arcs have directions and left and right polygons\nArcView uses non-topological shapefiles. Shapefiles define the geometry and\nattributes of map features in three basic files. The .shp file stores the feature geometry,\nthe .shx file maintains the index of the feature geometry, and the .dbf file stores the\nattributes of map features.\nAlthough the feature geometry file in ArcView saves a point as a pair of X, Y\ncoordinates, a line as a series of points, and a polygon as a series of lines, no files\ndescribe the spatial relationship among geometric objects. For example, polygons in a\nshapefile have duplicate arcs and can overlap one another, thus violating the topology\nrequired for a polygon coverage.\n5",

Use of shapefiles, however, has\ntwo main advantages: (1) they display more rapidly on a view than ARC/INFO\ncoverages, and (2) they are not proprietary and can be used directly in other GIS\nsoftware packages such as MapInfo and GeoMedia.\nShapefiles can be converted to ARC/INFO coverages, and vice versa. The\nconversion from a shapefile to a coverage requires the building of topological\nrelationships and the removal of duplicate arcs. The conversion from a coverage to a\nshapefile is simpler. But if a coverage has topological errors, such as lines not joined\nperfectly, the errors can result in missing features in the shapefile.\n1.2. Raster Data Model\nThe raster data model uses a regular grid to cover the space and the value in each\ngrid cell to correspond to the characteristic of a spatial phenomenon at the cell\nlocation. Conceptually, the variation of the spatial phenomenon is reflected by the\nchanges in the cell value. Raster data have been described as field-based, as opposed to\nobject-based vector data. A wide variety of data used in GIS are encoded in raster\nformat. They include digital elevation data, satellite images, digital orthophotos,\nscanned maps, and graphic files. Most GIS packages can display raster and vector\ndata simultaneously, and can convert from raster to vector data or from vector to\nraster data. Raster data also introduce a large set of data analysis functions to GIS.\nIntegration of both vector and raster data is a common feature in a GIS project.\nA grid consists of rows, columns, and cells. The origin of rows and columns is at\nthe upper left corner of the grid. Rows function as Y coordinates and columns as X\ncoordinates in a two-dimensional coordinate system. A cell is defined by its location in\nterms of row and column. The cell size determines the resolution of the raster data\nmodel. A cell size of 30 meters means that each cell measures 30 × 30 meters.\nRaster data represent points by single cells, lines by sequences of neighboring\ncells, and areas by collections of contiguous cells. Each cell in a grid carries a value,\neither an integer or a floating-point value (a value with decimal digits). Integer cell\nvalues typically represent categorical data (i.e., nominal or ordinal data). For example,\na land cover model may use 1 for urban land use, 2 for forested land, 3 for water\nbodies, and so on. Floating-point cell values represent continuous data (i.e., interval\nor ratio data). For example, a precipitation model may have precipitation values of\n20.15 inch, 12.23 inch, and so forth.\n6",

        "content": "MAP PROJECTIONS\nA map projection is the transformation of Earth’s curved surface (or a portion of)\nonto a two-dimensional flat surface by means of mathematical equations. During such\ntransformation, the angular geographic coordinates (latitude, longitude) referencing\npositions on the surface of the Earth are converted to Cartesian coordinates (x, y)\nrepresenting position of points on a flat map.\nMap projection transforms the spatial relationship of map features on the Earth’s\nsurface to a flat map. Map projection enables a map user to work with two-\ndimensional coordinates, rather than spherical or three-dimensional coordinates. But\nthe transformation from the Earth’s surface to a flat surface always involves distortion\nand no map projection is perfect. This is why hundreds of map projections have been\ndeveloped for mapmaking, each with its own parameters.\nA coordinate system is based on a map projection. Plane coordinate systems are\ntypically used in large-scale mapping such as a scale of 1:24,000 or larger. Coordinate\nsystems are designed for detailed calculations and positioning. Therefore, accuracy in\na feature’s absolute position and its relative position to other features is more\nimportant than the preserved property of a map projection.\nMap projections are grouped into four classes by their preserved properties:\nconformal, equal area or equivalent, equidistant, and azimuthal or true direction. A\nconformal projection preserves local shapes. An equivalent projection represents areas\nin correct relative size. An equidistant projection maintains consistency of scale for\ncertain distances. An azimuthal projection retains certain accurate directions.\nCartographers often use a geometric object to illustrate how a map projection can\nbe constructed. For example, by placing a cylinder tangent to a lighted globe, a\nprojection can be made by tracing the lines of longitude and latitude onto the\ncylinder. The cylinder in this case is the projection surface, and the globe is called the\nreference globe. Other common projection surfaces include a cone and a plane. A map\nprojection is called a cylindrical projection if it can be constructed using a cylinder, a\nconic projection using a cone, and an azimuthal using a plane.\n7",

The cylinder is then cut lengthwise and unwrapped to form\na flat map.\nTangent vs. secant cylindrical projection\nThe cylinder may be either tangent or secant to the reference surface of the Earth. In\nthe tangent case, the cylinder’s circumference touches the reference globe’s surface along\na great circle (any circle having the same diameter as the sphere and thus dividing it\ninto two equal halves). The diameter of the cylinder is equal to the diameter of the\nglobe. The tangent line is the equator for the equatorial or normal aspect; while in the\ntransverse aspect, the cylinder is tangent along a chosen meridian (i.e. central meridian).\nIn the secant case, the cylinder intersects the globe; that is the diameter of the cylinder is\nsmaller than the globe’s. At the place where the cylinder cuts through the globe two\nsecant lines are formed.\nThe tangent and secant lines are important since scale is constant along these lines\n(equals that of the globe), and therefore there is no distortion (scale factor = 1). Such lines\nof true scale are called standard lines. These are lines of equidistance. Distortion increases\nby moving away from standard lines.\nIn normal aspect of cylindrical projection, the secant or standard lines are along two\nparallels of latitude equally spaced from equator, and are called standard parallels.

It is based on a spheroid geographic coordinate system, but it uses linear\nunits of measure for coordinates. It is also known as Cartesian coordinate system.\nIn such a coordinate system the location of a point on the grid is identified by (x,\ny) coordinate pair and the origin lies at the centre of grid. The x coordinate determines\nthe horizontal position and y coordinate determines the vertical position of the point.\n14",

Another is remote sensing, which provides an increasingly\nimportant source of data, with the powerful advantage that it is global in scope. The\nGlobal Positioning System (GPS) is a constellation of satellites designed to allow\nposition on the Earth's surface to be determined to a known level of accuracy. Each\nsatellite transmits signals that are precisely timed by on-board atomic clocks; a receiver\non Earth is able to resolve position in three dimensions if at least four satellite signals\nare being received. A simple hand-held receiver, available for a few hundred dollars, is\ncapable of determining position to an accuracy of tens of meters, and versions of the\ntechnology exist capable of determining relative position to centimeter accuracy, and to\nmeters in vehicles moving at speed. A technically distinct Russian system can be used in\nconjunction with GPS to improve positioning.\nOne unexpected consequence of the widespread use of GIS, for ocean and air\nnavigation and for positioning scientific observations, is that it exposes the inaccuracies\nin much of the world's published mapping, and the inconsistencies between the\nmathematical figures of the Earth that support mapping. Unfortunately for global\nchange science, mapping remains an activity of strategic importance in many parts of\nthe Earth, and there are very significant gaps in scientific access to good base mapping.\nGIS makes increasing use of electronic communication. There are now many archives of\ngeographic information of value to global change science that are accessible to anyone\nconnected to the Internet. The EOS (Earth Observing System) Data and Information\nSystem (EOSDIS) is one prominent example. With no more than a standard World Wide\nWeb browser, a user is able to access the archive, browse its contents, and in many cases\ndownload large and potentially valuable data sets. Such archives of geographic\ninformation are being sponsored by national and state governments, non-governmental\norganizations, universities, and research libraries. It is also increasingly possible to\nmanipulate the data in an archive at its source, allowing full use of GIS functions\nwithout the necessity to download what is often a very large set of data.\n15",

        "content": "Definition for GIS\nA geographic information system (GIS) is a system designed to capture, store,\nmanipulate, analyze, manage, and present all types of geographical data for decision\nmaking.\nHISTORY OF GIS DEVELOPMENT\nThe idea of portraying different layers of data on a series of base maps, and\nrelating things geographically, has been around much older than computers invention.\nThousands years ago, the early man used to draw pictures of the animals they hunted\non the walls of caves. These animal drawings are track lines and tallies thought to\ndepict migration routes. While simplistic in comparison to modern technologies, these\nearly records mimic the two-element structure of modern geographic information\nsystems, an image associated with attribute information.\nPossibly the earliest use of the geographic method, in 1854 John Snow depicted a\ncholera outbreak in London using points to represent the locations of some individual\ncases. His study of the distribution of cholera led to the source of the disease, a\ncontaminated water pump within the heart of the cholera outbreak. While the basic\nelements of topology and theme existed previously in cartography, the John Snow map\nwas unique, using cartographic methods, not only to depict but also to analyze, clusters\nof geographically dependent phenomena for the first time.\nThe early 20th century saw the development of \"photo lithography\" where maps\nwere separated into layers. Computer hardware development spurred by nuclear\nweapon research led to general-purpose computer \"mapping\" applications by the early\n1960s. In the year 1962, the world's first true operational GIS was developed by the\nfederal Department of Forestry and Rural Development in Ottawa, Canada by Dr.\nRoger Tomlinson. It was called the \"Canada Geographic Information System\" (CGIS)\nand was used to store, analyze, and manipulate data collected for the Canada Land\nInventory (CLI). It is an initiative to determine the land capability for rural Canada by\nmapping information about soils, agriculture, recreation, wildlife, forestry, and land use\nat a scale of 1:50,000.\nCGIS was the world's first \"system\" and was an improvement over \"mapping\"\napplications as it provided capabilities for overlay, measurement, and digitizing or\nscanning. It supported a national coordinate system that spanned the continent, coded\nlines as \"arcs\" having a true embedded topology, and it stored the attribute and location\nspecific information in a separate files. Dr. Tomlinson is known as the \"father of GIS,\"\nfor his use of overlays in promoting the spatial analysis of convergent geographic data.\nIn 1964, Howard T Fisher formed the Laboratory for Computer Graphics and\nSpatial Analysis at the Harvard Graduate School of Design, where a number of\nimportant theoretical concepts in spatial data handling were developed. This lab had\nmajor influence on the development of GIS until early 1980s. Many pioneers of newer\nGIS \"grew up\" at the Harvard lab and had distributed seminal software code and\nsystems, such as 'SYMAP', 'GRID', and 'ODYSSEY'.\nBy the early 1980s, M&S Computing (later Intergraph), Environmental Systems\nResearch Institute (ESRI) and CARIS emerged as commercial vendors of GIS software,\nsuccessfully incorporating many of the CGIS features, combining the first generation\n16",

By the end of the 20th\ncentury, the rapid growth in various systems had been consolidated and standardized\non relatively few platforms and users were beginning to export the concept of viewing\nGIS 4 data over the Internet, requiring uniform data format and transfer standards.\nMore recently, there is a growing number of free, open source GIS packages, which run\non a range of operating systems and can be customized to perform specific tasks.

        "content": "LEVELS OF MEASUREMENT\nStandardized scales are needed to measure non-spatial attributes as well as\nspatial features. Unlike positions and distances, however, attributes of locations on the\nEarth's surface are often not amenable to absolute measurement. In a 1946 article in\nScience, a psychologist named S. S. Stevens outlined a system of four levels of\nmeasurement meant to enable social scientists to systematically measure and analyze\nphenomena that cannot simply be counted. (In 1997, geographer Nicholas Chrisman\npointed out that a total of nine levels of measurement are needed to account for the\nvariety of geographic data.) The levels are important to specialists in geographic\ninformation because they provide guidance about the proper use of different statistical,\nanalytical, and cartographic operations. In the following, we consider examples of\nStevens' original four levels of measurement: nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio.\nNominal Level\nThe term nominal simply means to relate to the word “name.” Simply put, nominal\nlevel data are data that are denoted with different names (e.g., forest, water, cultivated,\nwetlands), or categories. Data produced by assigning observations into unranked\ncategories are nominal level measurements. In relation to terminology used in Chapter\n1, nominal data are a type of categorical (qualitative) data. Specifically, nominal level\ndata can be differentiated and grouped into categories by “kind,” but are not ranked\nfrom high to low. For example, one can classify the land cover at a certain location as\nwoods, scrub, orchard, vineyard, or mangrove. There is no implication in this\ndistinction, however, that a location classified as \"woods\" is twice as vegetated as\nanother location classified \"scrub.\"\nOrdinal Level\nLike the nominal level of measurement, ordinal scaling assigns observations to\ndiscrete categories. Ordinal categories, however, are ranked, or ordered – as the name\nimplies. It was stated in the preceding section that nominal categories such as \"woods\"\nand \"mangrove\" do not take precedence over one another, unless a set of priorities is\nimposed upon them. This act of prioritizing nominal categories transforms nominal\nlevel measurements to the ordinal level. Because the categories are not based upon a\nnumerical value (just an indication of an order or importance), ordinal data are also\nconsidered to be categorical (or qualitative).\n22",

        "content": "Interval Level\nUnlike nominal- and ordinal-level data, which are categorical (qualitative) in\nnature, interval level data are numerical (quantitative). Examples of interval level data\ninclude temperature and year. With interval level data, the zero point is arbitrary on the\nmeasurement scale. For instance, zero degrees Fahrenheit and zero degrees Celsius are\ndifferent temperatures.\nRatio Level\nSimilar to interval level data, ratio level data are also numerical (quantitative).\nExamples of ratio level data include distance and area (e.g., acreage). Unlike the interval\nlevel measurement scale, the zero is not arbitrary for ratio level data. For example, zero\nmeters and zero feet mean exactly the same thing, unlike zero degrees Fahrenheit and\nzero degrees Celsius (both temperatures). Ratio level data also differs from interval\nlevel data in the mathematical operations that can be performed with the data. An\nimplication of this difference is that a quantity of 20 measured at the ratio scale is twice\nthe value of 10 (20 meters is twice the distance of 10 meters), a relation that does not\nhold true for quantities measured at the interval level (20 degrees is not twice as warm\nas 10 degrees).\nInterval and Ratio Level Data\nThe scales for both interval and ratio level data are similar in so far as units of\nmeasurement are arbitrary (Celsius versus Fahrenheit and English versus metric units).\nThese units of measurement are split evenly for each successive value (e.g., 1 meter, 2\nmeters (add 1 meter), 3 meters (add 1 meter), 4 meters (add 1 meter). Because interval\nand ratio level data represent positions along continuous number lines, rather than\nmembers of discrete categories, they are also amenable to analysis using statistical\ntechniques.\n23",
